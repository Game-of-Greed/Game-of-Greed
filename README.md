## Game of Greed
### Overview:

* Dice Game generate roll_dice for 6 rounds.
* each roll scores separately, with dice scored at the time they are rolled, so that three or more of a kind must be rolled simultaneously, and dice from later rolls do not "stack" for the higher score. In so-called progressive scoring, dice can form combinations with dice previously scored and set aside.
